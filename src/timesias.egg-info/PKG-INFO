Description: # Timesias
        Forcast outcomes from time-series history. This is the top-performing algorithm for [DII National Data Science Challenge](https://sbmi.uth.edu/news/story.htm?id=4a7fba5d-2bd9-402a-a3bb-a2f5d21d2fe3).

        ## Input data format
        
        The example data in the data/ are randomly generated data for the demonstration of the algorithm.
        
        Two types of data is requied for model training and prediction:
        * `gs.file`: `.txt` file two columns. The first column is file name index. The second column is the gold standard (0/1), representing the final outbreak of sepsis
        
        ``` 
        0.psv,1
        1.psv,1
        2.psv,0
        3.psv,1
        4.psv,0
        5.psv,1
        6.psv,1
        ``` 
        
        * `*.psv`: `.psv` table files separated by `|`, which is the time-series feature records.
        	The header of psv file are the feature names. To note, the first column is the time index.
        
        ``` 
        HR|feature_1|feature_2|...|feature_n-1|feature_n
        0.0|1|0.0|...|1.3|0.0 
        1.0|NaN|0.0|...|0.0|0.0
        3.5|NaN|2.3|...|0.0|0.0
        ```
        ## Model training and cross validation
        ``` r
        timesias -g [GS_FILE_PATH] -t [LAST_N_RECORDS] -f [EXTRA_FEATURES] --shap
        ```
        
        * `GS_FILE_PATH`: the path to the gold-standard file; for example, `/data/gs.file`;
        * `LAST_N_RECORDS`: last n records to use for prediction. default: 16;
        * `EXTRA_FEATURES`: addtional features used for prediction. default: ['norm', 'std', 'missing_portion', 'baseline'], which are all features we used in DII Data challenge.
        
        also use
        
        ```r
         timesias --help
        ```
        to get instructions on the usage of our program.
        
        
        This will generate models, which will be saved under a new directory `./models`.
        
        Evaluation results during five-fold cross validation will be stored in `eva.tsv`.
        
        
        # Top feature evaluation
        
        if `--shap` is indicated, SHAP analysis will be carried out to show top contributing measurements and last nth time points. This will generate an html report (`top_feature_report.html`) like the following:
        
        <p align="center">
        <img width="800", src ="https://github.com/GuanLab/sepsis/blob/master/top_feature_report_example.png">
        </p>
        
        The corresponding shap values will be stored in `shap_group_by_measurment.csv` and `shap_group_by_timeslot.csv`.
        
        ## Other applications of this method
        
        This method can be generalized to be used on other hospitalization data. One application of this method is the [COVID-19 DREAM Challenge](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn21849255/wiki/602411), where this method also achieves top performance.
